# Managethis
A lightweight way to manage your HTPC.

This is based off of: https://codyhouse.co/gem/responsive-tabbed-navigation/

This is a lightweight way to manage your HTPC apps without having to run anything extra, all you need is to have a webserver. It basically acts as a portal for all of your apps in once place so you don't need to keep multiple tabs open.

## Setup

- To set it up clone and place the folder inside the root directory of your webserver then open index.html in your favourite editor.
- Edit the parts marked as "replace me" with the urls of your apps.
- Change the icons by replacing them with ones from http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.0.0/docs/components/ or http://fontawesome.io/icons/
- Navigate to http://youripaddress/Managethis to access Managethis.
- To reload an app, double click it in the menu. Only that specific page will reload.

You may want to setup htaccess to secure it but even if you don't your apps will not be accessible as long as they themselves are secure.
