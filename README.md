# Managethis
A lightweight manager for your HTPC

This is based off of: https://codyhouse.co/gem/responsive-tabbed-navigation/

This is a lightwieight way to manage your HTPC apps without having to run anything extra, all you need is to have a webserver. It basically acts as a portal for all of your apps in once place so you don't need to keep multiple tabs open.

## Setup

- To set it up place the folder inside your root directory then open the index.html in your favourite editor.
- Now edit the parts marked as "replace me" with the urls of your apps.
- Navigate to http://youripaddress/Managethis to access it.

You may want to setup htaccess to secure it but even if you don't your apps will not be accessible as long as they themselves are secure.

Basically do what you want with it, I'm not much of a coder and hope someone can improve on what I started.
